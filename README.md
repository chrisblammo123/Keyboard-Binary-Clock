# Keyboard-Binary-Clock

Small project to see if I could make my Wooting keyboard into a binary clock using their [RGB-SDK](https://github.com/WootingKb/wooting-rgb-sdk).

Made each set of keys (seconds, minutes, and hours) a different RGB color (seconds is red, minutes is green, hours is blue). All other keys are set to be white, and the brightness of the binary keys is determined of it is 'on' or 'off' (i.e. pure red vs light red/pink).
